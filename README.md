With increasing demands on food production, Artificial Intelligence is being used in the Agricultural domain to automate visual inspection tasks and to perform robotic harvesting. Semantic Segmentation is a specific Deep Learning problem which involves labelling regions by assigning every pixel in an image to a meaningful class. The difficulty in performing Semantic Segmentation in an agricultural setting is that it can be difficult for a Convolutional Neural Network to cater for all environmental conditions such as change in seasons and weather along with the large amount of variance between crops. This project aims to address this issue by using Neural Style Transfer techniques to augment the dataset and improve generalisation.
